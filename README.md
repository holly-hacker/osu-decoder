Not affiliated with osu! or ppy Pty Ltd ;)

## What is this?
This is a private tool I used to decrypt osu!'s symbol names, allowing me to view osu!'s code as if I got it from the original source. Since peppy changed his encryption key and it can no longer be considered public domain, I believe it is safe to publish this tool publicly.

## Usage
It has a help menu, you can figure it out. You probably want to run your input through [EazFixer](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/EazFixer) first.

## FAQ

### It doesn't work!
As of 26/03/2019 (v3098), peppy has changed the encryption key used for encrypting symbol names. This tool will only work on osu! builds before that date (that are still obfuscated by EazFuscator).

### This looks decompiled! Did you even write this yourself??
You can tell from commit [3d15ab](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-decoder/commit/3d15ab56f221e7f005b3efe7adee5ea04f2a2db9) that the source in this repo started from a decompiled program. I was an idiot and just lost the original source a few years ago.
